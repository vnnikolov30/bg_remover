## REQUIREMENTS ‚öôÔ∏è
As same as last time 

üî¥ YOU NEED CUSTOMTKINTER AND PYGAME INSTALLED IN ORDER TO RUN THE CODE! üî¥
<br>
Luckily you can just go into your terminal and paste the following **`pip install -r requirements. txt`**

After that you're good to go! ‚úÖ

Again i've tried to make it as simple as it gets. 

ONE BUTTON DOES ALL! 

But this time i've actually added a way to stop the music 
<br>
(*although i really don't see why you would want to use it... It's only playing the best song in the entire galaxy* ;])

I've also added a hidden easter egg ü•ö:)


#

## WORK IN PROGRESS... üöß
So i've tried numerous times to export the whole program as a single .exe file for easy use but CustomTkinter won't cooperate...
<br>
So untill i figure this out you're stuck using the remover inside an IDE.
